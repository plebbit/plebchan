# Refactor Pass

Identify the requested scope from the conversation and diff; include relevant staged, unstaged, and untracked work. If no scope is supplied, inspect recent task changes without expanding into unrelated code.

Prefer removing dead code, clarifying control flow, or reusing existing helpers over adding abstractions. Read surrounding source and tests before changing a boundary. Check history when the purpose of a guard, workaround, or optimization is unclear; keep it when its necessity cannot be established.

Preserve observable behavior, error contracts, accessibility, and project architecture. Remove memoization only when its purpose and impact are understood. Shared/global state belongs in Zustand; local state and straightforward prop passing remain valid. Use Bitsocial hooks for React UI protocol data and derive values during render when appropriate. Preserve intentional non-React integrations such as Electron RPC bootstrap.

Keep the diff focused and avoid new dependencies for routine cleanup. Verify the affected behavior using `docs/agent-playbooks/verification.md`; report what became simpler and any remaining uncertainty.
