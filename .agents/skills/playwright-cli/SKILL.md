# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Resource Budget (MUST)

One Playwright browser session may be active at a time, machine-wide. The budget is shared by every worktree and by any other checkout that ships this wrapper, because the contended resource is machine RAM and CPU rather than the repository. Playwright disables normal background throttling, so hidden 5chan pages keep P2P and rendering work active after a check.

- During iteration, use Chrome/Blink only. Run the full cross-browser matrix once the change is ready for final verification.
- Open every fresh session through `./scripts/pw-session.sh open <session> ...`; it acquires the shared browser slot.
- Reuse the same engine session for desktop and mobile by resizing it.
- Close it with `./scripts/pw-session.sh close <session>` in a finally-style cleanup before opening another engine. `close` stops the browser even when the lock was already lost, so it is always the right cleanup call.
- Run browser engines and profiler batches sequentially. Never spawn browser-driving agents in parallel.
- Exit code 75 means the slot is busy. Finish non-browser work and retry, or block on `./scripts/pw-session.sh open --wait[=SECONDS] <session> ...` (default 300s). Do not bypass the lock.
- Never use `playwright-cli close-all` or `kill-all` while concurrent agents may own sessions.
- A lock left behind by an interrupted workflow clears itself: the next `open` reclaims any slot whose browser is no longer running. Inspect the holder with `./scripts/pw-session.sh status`, which reports whether that browser is still alive. `release <session>` is a last resort for the rare case where `status` cannot verify the browser state.

## Cross-Browser UI Verification

When using `playwright-cli` to verify rendering, styling, layout, or interactions in this repo, run the relevant flow in all three major browser engines:

- `chrome` for Blink
- `firefox` for Gecko
- `webkit` for Safari/WebKit coverage

Use separate short named sessions per engine, compare the results, and record any engine-specific differences instead of treating Chromium output as sufficient. Run them sequentially:

```bash
./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-chrome http://example.com --browser=chrome
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-chrome

./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-firefox http://example.com --browser=firefox
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-firefox

./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify-webkit http://example.com --browser=webkit
# Run the desktop and mobile flow, then release the slot.
./scripts/pw-session.sh close verify-webkit
```

## Quick start

```bash
# open new browser
./scripts/pw-session.sh open example
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli -s=example goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli -s=example click e15
playwright-cli -s=example type "page.click"
playwright-cli -s=example press Enter
# take a screenshot
playwright-cli -s=example screenshot
# close the browser
./scripts/pw-session.sh close example
```

## Session mode selection

Default to a fresh isolated browser session for reproducible verification.

Before browser work where existing state may matter, explicitly confirm the mode if the user has not already said which one they want:

1. Fresh isolated `playwright-cli` session
2. Current browser session reuse

Existing state usually matters when the task depends on auth, cookies, extensions, open tabs, or reproducing something already happening in the contributor's browser.

Do not attach to a live personal browser session without explicit approval.

If current-session reuse is requested, prefer the supported attach path in the local setup:

```bash
# Fresh isolated browser (default)
./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify https://example.com

# Reusable Playwright-managed profile
./scripts/pw-session.sh open verify https://example.com --persistent

# Attach to an existing browser when the local extension bridge is set up
./scripts/pw-session.sh open example --extension
```

If the task requires the contributor's current browser session and the attach path is not available in the current setup, stop and ask whether to switch to a fresh session or provide an explicit CDP-based Playwright script.

All interaction examples below use the named `example` session. Replace it with the session you opened through the wrapper. Browser-open examples are alternatives; close the active session before selecting another.
