description: Automate a full 5chan release — analyze commits, update release body and blotter, bump version, generate changelog, commit, tag, and push. Use when the user says "release", "new version", "cut a release", "prepare release", or provides a version number to ship.

# Release

End-to-end release automation for 5chan.

## Usage

The user provides a version bump (`patch`, `minor`, `major`, or explicit `x.y.z`).
If omitted and it cannot be inferred from an explicitly approved release plan, ask which bump level they want.

For “dry run” or “preview,” only inspect history and show the proposed version, release text, blotter, and changed-file list. Do not edit files or run mutating generators. “Prepare release” authorizes local preparation; publishing requires a request to ship/publish/push. Reuse authorization already given.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Release Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze commits
- [ ] Step 2: Write release body (longer sentence)
- [ ] Step 3: Write blotter message (concise keywords)
- [ ] Step 4: Bump version in package.json
- [ ] Step 5: Generate changelog
- [ ] Step 6: Update blotter file
- [ ] Step 7: Verify blotter
- [ ] Step 8: Commit, tag, push
```

### Step 1 — Analyze commits

```bash
git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -1
```

Then list commits since that tag:

```bash
git log --oneline <tag>..HEAD
```

If there are no new commits, stop — nothing to release.

Categorize by Conventional Commits prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.).

### Step 2 — Write the release body one-liner

Edit `oneLinerDescription` in `scripts/release-body.js` (around line 105).

Rules:
- Start with "This version..." or "This release..."
- One sentence, no bullets
- Lead with the biggest features/fixes, group minor ones
- Plain language (user-facing)
- End with a period

Good examples:
- "This version adds backlinks for quoted posts, a copy user ID menu item, and clearer reply previews."
- "This release adds pseudonymity mode support per-reply and fixes timezone display issues."

### Step 3 — Write the blotter message

This is a **separate, shorter** summary used for the in-app blotter banner. **The blotter is read by end users — non-developers — so every highlight must be understandable to someone who has never seen the code.** This rule is non-negotiable even for internal/infrastructure changes that make it into the blotter.

Format rules:
- Comma-separated key highlights, each a short plain-English phrase (not a full sentence)
- Omit "This version..." prefix — the blotter script prepends `vX.Y.Z: ` automatically
- Aim for ~45–70 characters after the version prefix
- **Only genuinely novel or noteworthy items** — things a user would find interesting or exciting
- Skip regression fixes (restoring something that previously worked), routine bug fixes, invisible security/stability work, minor z-index/modal/layout tweaks, test improvements, CI changes, and anything that isn't a new capability or a significant user-facing improvement
- If something was already a known feature and just got fixed/restored, it does not belong in the blotter
- Fewer strong items beat many weak items; 1–3 highlights is ideal
- If there are no genuinely interesting user-facing changes, do not invent filler highlights
- Lead with the most impressive item

Plain-English rules (apply always, no matter what):
- Write for a user who has never read the code. Each highlight must be self-explanatory to a non-dev reader of 5chan.
- No internal library or module names (e.g. "Pretext", "Zustand", "portless", "Vite", "oxlint"). Translate into the user-visible effect.
- No dev shorthand: avoid "perf", "deps", "refactor", "impl", "selector", "reducer", "hook", "a11y", "i18n", "DX", "CI", "CD", "lint", "typecheck".
- No codebase-only identifiers, file paths, component names, or PR numbers.
- Prefer the user-visible *outcome* over the mechanism. Example: "compact account history" (describes the code) → "performant account history" (describes what the user gets).
- Phrases must read as natural plain English. If a highlight needs a developer to explain it, rewrite it.
- Avoid broad maintenance labels like "security fixes", "bug fixes", or "stability fixes"; they are usually invisible, redundant, and dull. Only mention security or stability work when the user can perceive the outcome, and phrase it as that outcome.
- Okay to name concrete user-visible features/areas: "Board pagination", "Video auto-unmute setting", "File upload improvements", "Archive page", "Spoiler tags", "Catalog search".

Good examples (the part **you** write, without the `vX.Y.Z:` prefix):
- "Board pagination, file upload improvements, mod queue redesign, catalog sorting"
- "Video auto-unmute setting, platform info on homepage, faster board previews"
- "In-app desktop updates, opt-in thread auto-refresh, performant account history"
- "Quote references in replies, post backlinks"

Bad examples (and why):
- "Pretext feed sizing" — names an internal library; user has no idea what this is.
- "Mobile scroll perf" — "perf" is dev shorthand; say "smoother mobile scrolling".
- "Compact account history" — describes the implementation; "performant account history" describes what the user gets.
- "Refactor memoized selectors" — three dev terms in a row; rewrite or drop.
- "Security fixes" — generic maintenance label; invisible to regular users and not interesting to read.

Save this string — you will pass it to the blotter script in Step 6.

### Step 4 — Bump version

Read `package.json`, compute the new version from the bump level, and update the `"version"` field. Run `corepack yarn install` to keep the lockfile synchronized.

| Bump | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `patch` | `0.6.7` → `0.6.8` |
| `minor` | `0.6.7` → `0.7.0` |
| `major` | `0.6.7` → `1.0.0` |
| `x.y.z` | Set exactly |

### Step 5 — Generate changelog

```bash
yarn changelog
```

This regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` from conventional commits.

### Step 6 — Update blotter

Pass the **blotter message from Step 3** (not the release body):

```bash
node scripts/update-blotter.js release --message "<blotter message>"
```

### Step 7 — Verify blotter

```bash
node scripts/update-blotter.js check
```

If it fails, fix the issue and re-run.

### Step 8 — Commit, tag, push

Run the required final verification and inspect the release diff. Stage only the release files actually changed (version/lockfile, changelog, release body and blotter), plus any explicitly authorized prerequisite changes. Verify `git diff --cached` contains nothing unrelated. When publishing is authorized, create and push the exact release tag:

```bash
git add <reviewed-release-files>
git diff --cached
git commit -m "chore(release): v<version>"
git tag v<version>
git push origin HEAD
git push origin refs/tags/v<version>
```

GitHub Actions triggers on the pushed tag to build release artifacts.

## Dry-run mode

Preview is read-only: inspect the inputs and print proposed changes without editing the version, release body, changelog, blotter, index, commits, or tags.
