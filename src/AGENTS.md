# src/AGENTS.md

These rules apply to `src/**`. Follow the repo-root `AGENTS.md` first, then use this file for code inside the application source tree.

- Keep route composition in `src/views/`, reusable UI in `src/components/`, shared logic in `src/hooks/`, and shared app state in `src/stores/`.
- Before adding new state, decide whether it belongs in render, a reusable hook, or a Zustand store. Do not duplicate the same state logic across views.
- Use `@bitsocial/bitsocial-react-hooks` for data access. Do not add data-fetching `useEffect` calls or effects that only synchronize derived state.
- For state/effect/data-flow or rendering-performance changes, review relevant React guidance. Choose checks and browser/viewports using `docs/agent-playbooks/verification.md`; a copy edit alone does not require React Doctor or a full build.
- Prefer extending nearby tests under `src/**/__tests__/` when touching already-covered behavior.
